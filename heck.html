<h4 style="font-family:verdana;"> Hi Everyone! Nick "Hobo Herd" Gladding here with another album review. The album we will be reviewing this week is "The Revenge of Hobo Johnson". While many found this album terrible I can proudly say I had a nice experience listening to it. I will start this off by going over each track, giving it a rating, and then giving my thoughts on it. </h4>
<hr class="rounded">
<h5 style="font-family:verdana;"> Track 1: Anton LaVey</h3>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"> Anton LaVey is a love song to Satan. The title is fitting because Anton LaVey is the creator of satanism. The lyricism on this track was quite fitting to the overall theme of the song. However, the mixing was not very spectacular. Hobo Johnson is a spoken word artist so a lot of the track depends on his voice having a lot of enthusiasm to it. This track felt like he wrote down the lyrics and made it while he was depressed in his room on a Tuesday night. Overall, I cannot give this track a very high rating because the mixing wasn't great and he didn't sound really into it. </p>
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> Rating: 3/10 </h2>
<hr class="rounded">
<h5 style="font-family:verdana;"> Track 2: I want to see the World </h5>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"> This track was a single before the album released and so I was expecting the production and the lyricism to be better. I was correct and had a pleasant suprise when moving on to this track. We can see on this track Hobo Johnson starts to get a bit political like he has on earlier albums (see "You & The Cockroach"). I always apprecaite him using his lyricism to bring up important topics that wouldn't usually be included in music in such a manner. This track was a lot nicer to hear than Anton LaVey. </p>
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> Rating: 9/10 </h2>
<hr class="rounded">
<h5 style="font-family:verdana;"> Track 3: I want you back </h5>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"> This track is where Hobo Johnson in my opinion really starts heating up. His refrains seem a lot more powerful and he no longer seems depressed on a Tuesday night in his room. The instrumentals are better in my opinion and sound a lot more professional. It makes sense that this was the second single off of the album. He really seems to be enjoying himself while giving off a similar vibe to "Peach Scone" which is good given Peach Scone is what made him get so popular. This song has the most plays out of all of them on the album. It was a nice listen but I'm a bit afraid it's all downhill from here. </p>
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> Rating: 10/10 </h2>
<hr class="rounded">
<h5 style="font-family:verdana;"> Track 4: My therapist </h5>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"> This track is definitely when Hobo Johnson starts winding down. When I heard this track live at his album release party in Sacramento he told a heartfelt story of how he told his therapist all his crazy ideas. In this song you really get to see the inner workings of his mind to see what some of those ideas are. He also once again gets political and talks about the 1973 political coup the United States staged in Venezuela. I would definitely say that this track was better than Anton LaVey but I wouldn't put it up there with I want you back either. I liked hearing it live a lot better than this recording of it. </p>
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> Rating: 7/10 </h2>
<hr class="rounded">
<h5 style="font-family:verdana;"> Track 5: Jordans house </h5>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"> Jordans house is a unique track. I appreciated it in person much more than hearing the recording once again. He put a lot of enthusiasm into getting the crowd to scream "Jordans House!" on the refrains. But on here he doesn't really put in that same enthusiasm. The repeating "Jordan's house" is really what makes or breaks this track. I can't say it is downright terrible because I saw it done well when he preformend it but it needs a lot of work. This whole album so far really feels like he recorded it in one day and then didn't really mix it well then kind of slapped it on Spotify and called it a day. I feel like without promotion this album would have done a lot worse than it did </p>
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> Rating: 5/10 </h2>
<hr class="rounded">
<h5 style="font-family:verdana;"> Track 6: Prequel to Animal Farm </h5>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"> If it wasn't already clear that Johnson is a socialist this track should really help point that out. The song title is an obvious reference to George Orwell's "Animal Farm". On the surface the book seems like a story about talking animals and their lives on a farm. If you dig a little bit deeper you can see it is a commentary on capatalistic societies as a whole "All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others". This track talks about adults not liking their jobs and counting down the minutes until they can quit. Obviously, Johnson loves commenting on the United States and life here specifically in Sacramento. I enjoyed this song because it's really feeling like Johnson is finding his true colors. </p>
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> Rating: 8/10 </h2>
<hr class="rounded">
<h5 style="font-family:verdana;"> Track 7: You want a baby </h5>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"> This track is less relatable to anyone who isn't in a serious relationship. It is mostly about him and his girlfriend wanting to have a baby. He doesn't want to pass down his issues onto a child but he also wants his girlfriend to be happy. This leads to him being really torn and not knowing how to deal with it. He is obviously very depressed in a similar way to "Anton LaVey". It was the third single off of the album and looking at the numbers compared to the other singles it didn't do well at all. I can see why it didn't do well. It seems like a song he wrote to process his feelings and therefore shouldn't be judged in a way that it was meant to be popular. For that reason I don't feel like I can rate it.
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> Rating: N/A </h2>
<hr class="rounded">
<h5 style="font-family:verdana;"> Track 8: You need help </h5>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"> Wow. I thought the last track was dark this one is... really difficult to listen to. It talks about him dealing with severe depression to the point where he wants to kill himself. He also talks about having impulsive thoughts of wanting to just end it all and thinking of what that might look like. I can't really talk much more about it but like the title says he definitely needs some help.
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> Rating: N/A </h2>
<hr class="rounded">
<h5 style="font-family:verdana;"> Track 9: Song 9 (The Government's Not Great) </h5>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"> This track is all over the place. It is kind of a review of the previous tracks. He goes on a rant about trying to make it as an artist by trying to open for some bigger artists. He then goes on a rant about how the government is not very great. I'm not sure what headspace he was in for these last three tracks but it was not good, that's for sure.
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> Rating: 5/10 </h2>
<hr class="rounded">
<h5 style="font-family:verdana;"> Final Thoughts </h5>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"> As depressing as it was I can honestly say I liked the album as a whole when I listened to him live in Sacramento. I really liked watching him get really animated for the first 7 tracks and then get really down to earth for the last three. He asked the crowd how many people were on anti-depressants and about half of them raised their hands up. I think he is doing some wonderful work destigmatizing depression. He shows that even celebreties can deal with depression and anxiety and really talks about it openly. I admire this about him. On a more professional note I can say for sure this will not be his best album in terms of general popularity. I liked it but it was a really niche thing. I can't say for sure if other people will like it for the same reasons I did. Also, if you only heard it in the format he distributed it in you could think "oh this album is garbage who would listen to it". But if you get the oppurtunity to see him live you would think a lot more highly of it I think. He said that he recorded it while on tour so that is why his voice didn't sound so great. It seemed like a really personal album to him and I applaud him for having the guts to put it out there. I know I wouldn't be able to talk about my mental health in a manner that is putting it out there for everyone to see. The outro mentioned "Hobo Johnson Alienates his Fanbase" we all thought that the songs such as "What's the AQI of this bong rip?" were just him messing around on the outro but it turned out to be real. They definitely were throwaways to the Revenge that he decided to put on there anyways.
<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"> Overall Album Rating: 8/10 </h2>
